<h2>1. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE</h2>

<div class="definition">
<h4>Definition of Culture</h4>
<p>Culture is the unique dominant pattern of shared beliefs, assumptions, values, and norms that shape the socialization, symbols, language and practices of a group of people. It represents the attitudes and approaches that typify the way staff carry out their tasks.</p>
</div>

<h3>Requirements for Culture to Exist</h3>
<ol>
<li>Must be shared by the vast majority of members of a group or society</li>
<li>Must be passed on from generation to generation</li>
<li>Must shape behaviour and perceptions</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cultural Iceberg Model</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Observable Elements</th>
<th>Not Observable Elements</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Practices, Language, Symbols</td>
<td>Norms, Values, Assumptions</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Key Components of Culture</h3>

<h4>Shared Assumptions</h4>
<p>Thoughts and feelings that members of a culture take for granted and believe to be true.</p>

<h4>Values and Norms</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Values:</strong> Basic beliefs that specify general preferences and behaviours, define what is right and wrong</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Values:</strong> Reflected in society's morals, customs and established practices</li>
<li><strong>Norms:</strong> Rules that govern behaviours of groups of people</li>
</ul>

<h4>Symbols</h4>
<p>Any visible object, act, or event that conveys meaning to others</p>
<ul>
<li>Artefacts</li>
<li>Dress</li>
<li>Office layout</li>
<li>Slogans</li>
<li>Ceremonies</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> The Nike swoosh symbolizes the Greek goddess Nike (winged goddess of victory) and represents her flight, conveying the brand meaning.
</div>

<h4>Language</h4>
<p>A shared system of vocal sounds, written signs, and/or gestures used to convey meaning among members of a culture.</p>

<h4>Practices</h4>
<p>Observable cultural customs such as taboos (culturally forbidden behaviours) and ceremonies.</p>

<h4>Socialization</h4>
<p>The process by which people learn values, norms, behaviours and social skills. It is the means by which new members are brought into a culture.</p>

<h2>3. CULTURE AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE</h2>

<div class="key-point">
<h4>Relationship</h4>
<p>Organizational culture has the potential to enhance organizational performance, individual satisfaction, and the sense of certainty about how problems are to be handled. Culture serves as a control mechanism to channel behaviour towards desired behaviours and prevent undesired behaviours.</p>
</div>

<li><strong>Generation Y (Echo Boomers/Millennials):</strong> 1977-1994</li>
<li><strong>Generation Z:</strong> 1995-2012</li>
</ul>
<p>Creates communication gap due to lingo, slang and technology. Requires training for Generation X and Y.</p>
<div class="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Companies like Infosys, Wipro, Microsoft give regular training to employees.
</div>

<h4>2. Gender</h4>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> IBM believes strong transgender policies are natural extension of corporate culture.
</div>

<h4>5. Intellectual Abilities</h4>
<p>Employees have different thinking, reasoning and problem-solving approaches. Organizations should give freedom to think in their own ways.</p>
<div class="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Intel Inc. gives freedom to employees to think differently.
</div>

<h4>6. Values, Attitude, Personality</h4>
<p>To manage deep level diversity, organizations should give individual training.</p>
</div>

<h2>8. CREATIVE INTELLIGENCE - FIVE COMPETENCIES</h2>

<div class="definition">
<h4>Introduction to Knowledge Mining</h4>
<p>Knowledge Mining explores different kinds of knowledge acquisition. It involves Embodiment (becoming aware of creative knowledge and skills) and Immersion (diving fully into topics until they become second nature). You don't need to be an expert to be a knowledge miner - just observe and explore. The more knowledge you mine, the more dots you connect and patterns you see.</p>
</div>

<h3>1. EMBODIMENT</h3>
<div class="key-point">
<p>Embodiment begins with knowing yourself: who you are, your cultures, and what you want to create in the world. The ability to recognize unspoken aspirations of your groups and cultures is a skill many creative people share.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>We often overlook knowledge we naturally possess from life experiences, not formal practice</li>
<li>This knowledge is intuitive, so we may not see it as "knowledge" we were taught</li>
<li>Embodiment is not required for creating, but it's a valuable pool of often underappreciated insight</li>
<li>Key point: Be aware of your skills, knowledge, beliefs, and gaps that may affect understanding new groups</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. IMMERSION</h3>
<div class="key-point">
<p>Not everyone wants to remain in their birth culture; we seek new experiences, people, and ways of life. Immersion allows learning about other groups' beliefs, habits, and skills.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Many creative individuals leave familiar worlds to gain new skills and perspectives</li>
<li>Immersion is the type of Knowledge Mining we are most familiar with</li>
<li>As students, we immerse in history, literature, science to understand them</li>
<li>Rarely do we see immersion as a creative competence</li>
<li>Knowledge gained through deep study can be mined to generate creativity</li>
<li>For creativity, it can be better to learn widely rather than focus only on becoming the best in one field</li>
<li>Society often discourages following curiosity; arts and "extraneous" subjects are underfunded</li>
<li>Immersion across diverse subjects builds essential knowledge dots for creative thinking</li>
<li>Immersion is open-ended and liberating: choose what interests you and gather as many knowledge dots as possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. CONNECTING DOTS</h3>
<div class="key-point">
<p>Connecting dots often starts by reviewing your own or others' past work and finding ways to create something new.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>First step: Build bridges between seemingly unrelated islands of knowledge - also called lateral, relational, or horizontal thinking</li>
<li>Knowledge Mining doesn't require generating hundreds of random ideas like traditional brainstorming</li>
<li>Drawing from personal or organizational experiences to innovate sounds appealing but isn't always easy</li>
<li>With countless possibilities, deciding which dot to connect first can be challenging in a universe of infinite knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. DONUT KNOWLEDGE</h3>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Donut knowledge is the ability to see what isn't there.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>How to gain it? Time - experience and exploration are key</li>
<li>This may involve leaving the familiar and going to new places, physically or intellectually, even if uncomfortable</li>
<li>Even if you've yet to amass experience in a particular field, you can still improve your chances of spotting surprises you may not be expecting</li>
</ul>

<h4>Strategies to Improve Donut Knowledge</h4>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Strategy</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Know the Pattern, Watch for the Breaks</td>
<td>Understand normal patterns to recognize anomalies</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bird the Birders</td>
<td>Whatever your interests are, surround yourself with people who know how to look for the odd. This tends to increase your own chances of finding the rarity.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>5. DREAMS, NOT NEEDS</h3>
<div class="key-point">
<p>Focuses on understanding what people find meaningful beyond their basic needs.</p>
</div>

<h4>Key Ideas</h4>
<ul>
<li>Society often frames life in terms of needs, but humans are driven by dreams, longings, and meaning</li>
<li>Products like iPhones are not necessities, yet hold deep personal significance</li>
<li>Knowledge mining involves understanding what is meaningful and how it changes across cultures and generations</li>
<li>Encourages individuals and organizations to stay connected to the world and create meaningful offerings</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> iPhones are not basic needs but carry deep personal significance and meaning for users.
</div>

<h3>Building Foundation for Creativity Through Knowledge Mining</h3>

<div class="important">
<h4>Organizations and Knowledge Mining</h4>
<ul>
<li>Younger employees often bring ideas for new products, but experienced colleagues may overlook their value</li>
<li>Many organizations assume younger staff are there to learn and assist, not innovate</li>
<li>Overlooking employees' insights can be costly for organizations</li>
<li>Companies should audit employee skills and interests to identify creative potential</li>
<li>Policies like "percent time" or free time let employees work on projects they find meaningful</li>
<li>Investing in employees' creative time builds the organization's Creative Intelligence</li>
<li>Individuals should start by recognizing their own skills and experiences to improve knowledge mining</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<strong>Example:</strong> Google's 20% time policy encouraged employees to spend one day a week on creative projects, producing successful services - until it was restricted to focus on Google+.
